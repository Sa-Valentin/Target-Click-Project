# Target Click Game

## Description

Target Click is a simple web game where the player has to click on random blocks that appear on the screen before the time runs out. The goal is to test reaction speed, and the game gets progressively harder with each level.

## Project Goals

I started programming this project two days ago and will be focusing on the basic game logic over the next fourteen days. The current goal is to make the blocks appear and disappear, and as the project develops, I will add more features such as:
- Additional levels of difficulty
- Lives system
- Satisfying animations
- Design improvements
- Music and sound effects

This project is a learning challenge for me to improve my JavaScript skills. I’m excited to see how I can progress with this simple game!

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Play

1. Click on the random blocks that appear on the screen.
2. Avoid missing them before the timer runs out.
3. Complete levels and enjoy the growing challenge!

## Future Improvements

- Implement more complex game mechanics.
- Add dynamic animations for blocks and timer.
- Improve UI/UX design.
- Add more sound effects and background music.

## Contributions

I’m open to tips, insights, and contributions to help me improve this project!
