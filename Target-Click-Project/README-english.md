# Target Click Game

## Description

**Target Click** is a simple web game designed to test the player's reaction speed. The goal is to click on the random blocks (Targets) that appear on the screen before the time runs out. The difficulty increases progressively, challenging the player with new dynamics and challenges.

## **Project Goals**  
This project was started as a learning challenge in JavaScript, aiming to develop skills in programming logic and create an interactive gaming experience. The initial focus was to implement the basic game logic by February 6, and this was completed in 4 days. Therefore, the project will continue to evolve as there are many improvements to be made.

The main goals include:  
- Add more difficulty levels.  
- Create dynamic and satisfying animations.  
- Improve the design and user experience (UI/UX).  
- Implement more sound effects.  
- Implement a ranking system.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **Firebase** (for authentication and data storage)

## **How to Play**  
1. Click on the blocks (Targets) that appear randomly on the screen.  
2. Avoid clicking outside the Target, as this will result in a loss of time.  
3. Respond quickly: the Targets now disappear after a while, penalizing the player if not clicked.  
4. For every Target clicked correctly, the timer gains additional time, which increases as the combo grows.

## **What's New in the Current Version (v1.4.0)**  
The latest version brings significant improvements and new features:

- **Firebase and Database Integration:**  
  The game is now fully integrated with the Firebase API, enabling email authentication, Google login, and integration with a database to store rankings and user data.

- **Enhanced Login and Registration Menu:**  
  A new, modern, and intuitive authentication menu has been added, allowing users to register and log in. Additionally, proper handling of attempts to register with an already existing email is now implemented.

- **Data Validation and Security:**  
  Security has been strengthened with rigorous validation for email, password, and username, ensuring the entered data is secure and correct. Measures have also been taken to prevent the browser from automatically saving the user's credentials.

- **Layout and Responsiveness Fixes:**  
  CSS adjustments fixed issues with element disconnections during page resizing, ensuring a consistent and responsive interface across different devices.

- **Sound Effects and Volume Control:**  
  Sound effects have been added when clicking the targets, with volume control options, providing a more immersive experience during gameplay.
