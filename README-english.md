# Target Click Game

## Description

**Target Click** is a simple web game where the player must click on the random blocks that appear on the screen before time runs out. The goal is to test reaction speed, and the game becomes progressively harder with each level. In the current version, the player must click on a "Target" that constantly changes its position. Hitting the "Target" adds time to the player’s clock, while missing it causes time to be lost.

## Project Goals

I started programming this project two days ago and will focus on the basic game logic until the 6th, when I expect to have the basic game built. The current goal is to make the blocks appear and disappear, and as the project progresses, I will add more features such as:
- Additional levels of difficulty
- Satisfying animations
- Design improvements
- Music and sound effects

This project is a learning challenge to improve my JavaScript skills.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Play

1. Click on the random blocks that appear on the screen.
2. Avoid missing them before the timer runs out.
3. When you click on the "Target", you gain time. If you miss, you lose time.

## New Features in the Current Version

- **Gameplay Improvements**: The time logic has been improved to be more challenging and interactive, because:
  
  - **Target Button**: The game now has a "Target" button that moves randomly across the screen. Clicking it adds time to the player’s timer.
  - **Time Loss**: If the player clicks anywhere on the screen that is not the "Target" or the pause button, they lose time.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more complex game mechanics.
- Add dynamic animations for the blocks and the timer.
- Improve the interface design (UI/UX).
- Add more sound effects and background music.
