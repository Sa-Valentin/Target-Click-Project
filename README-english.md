# Target Click Game

## Description
**Target Click** is a simple web game designed to test the player's reaction speed. The goal is to click on random blocks (Targets) that appear on the screen before time runs out. The difficulty progressively increases, challenging the player with new dynamics and challenges.

## Project Objectives
This project was started as a learning challenge in JavaScript, with the goal of developing skills in programming logic and creating an interactive game experience. The initial focus was to implement the basic game logic by February 6th, with progress aimed at adding more advanced features and polishing the game in subsequent versions.

The main objectives include:
- Adding more difficulty levels.
- Creating dynamic and satisfying animations.
- Improving design and user experience (UI/UX).
- Implementing music and sound effects.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Play
1. Click on the blocks (Targets) that appear randomly on the screen.
2. Avoid clicking outside the Target, as this will result in a time penalty.
3. React quickly: the Targets now disappear after a certain time, penalizing the player if not clicked in time.
4. With each correctly clicked Target, the timer gains additional time.

## New Features in the Current Version (v1.2.1)
The latest version brings improvements to difficulty balance, visual adjustments, and fixes for better adaptation on different devices:

- **Visual improvement of buttons:** Some buttons now feature integrated images, making interaction more pleasant and visually engaging.
- **Difficulty adjustment:** The difficulty curve has been refined, providing smoother transitions between levels and more balanced challenges.
- **Element positioning and scaling fix:** The positioning and sizing of elements have been adjusted to ensure better adaptation to different screen resolutions.
- **Overall visual improvement:** Enhancements in layout and visual details to make the experience smoother and more enjoyable.
