# Target Click Game

## **Description**  
Target Click is a simple web-based game designed to test the player's reaction speed. The objective is to click on random blocks (Targets) that appear on the screen before time runs out. The difficulty increases progressively, challenging the player with new dynamics and mechanics.

## **Project Goals**  
This project was started as a learning challenge in JavaScript, with the aim of developing programming logic skills and creating an interactive gaming experience. The initial focus was to implement the basic logic of the game by January 6th, with progress geared towards more advanced features and polishing in later versions.  

Key objectives include:  
- Adding more levels of difficulty.  
- Creating dynamic and satisfying animations.  
- Improving design and user experience (UI/UX).  
- Implementing music and sound effects.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **HTML**

## **How to Play**  
1. Click on the blocks (Targets) that appear randomly on the screen.  
2. Avoid clicking outside the Target, as this will result in a time penalty.  
3. React quickly: Targets now disappear after a few seconds, penalizing the player if they are not clicked.  
4. For each Target successfully clicked, additional time is added to the timer.
