# Target Click Game

## Description

**Target Click** is a simple web game designed to test the player's reaction speed. The goal is to click on the random blocks (Targets) that appear on the screen before time runs out. The difficulty increases progressively, challenging the player with new dynamics and challenges.

## **Project Goals**  
This project was started as a learning challenge in JavaScript, aiming to develop programming logic skills and create an interactive gaming experience. The initial focus was on implementing the basic game logic by 
February 6th, with progress directed towards more advanced features and polish in subsequent versions.  

The main objectives include:  
- Add more difficulty levels.  
- Create dynamic and satisfying animations.  
- Improve the design and user experience (UI/UX).  
- Implement music and sound effects.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**

## **How to Play**  
1. Click on the random blocks (Targets) that appear on the screen.  
2. Avoid clicking outside the Target, as it will result in a loss of time.  
3. React quickly: the Targets now disappear after a few seconds if not clicked, penalizing the player.  
4. For every correct Target clicked, the timer gains additional time.

## **What's New in the Current Version (v1.3.1)**  
The latest version brings new improvements and adjustments for an even more dynamic gaming experience:  
- **Styled Restart Button:**  
  Now, when time runs out, the restart button automatically appears with a refreshed design, making it easier to restart the game.  
- **Non-Selectable Elements:**  
  The title and on-screen information (time and combo) are no longer selectable by the mouse, eliminating the blue highlighting that occurred during gameplay.  
- **Time Bonus for Combo:**  
  As the combo grows, the player now receives time bonuses for each correct hit, making the gameplay more dynamic.  
- **General Challenge Progress Adjustment:**  
  Refinements in challenge progression make the game more balanced and challenging.
